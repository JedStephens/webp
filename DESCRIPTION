Title: A New Format For Lossless and Lossy Image Compression
Version: 0.1
Author: Jeroen Ooms
Maintainer: Jeroen Ooms <jeroen.ooms@stat.ucla.edu>
Description: Lossless webp images are 26% smaller in size compared to PNG. Lossy
    webp images are 25-34% smaller in size compared to JPEG. This package can read
    and write webp images into a 3 or 4 channel bitmap array (using conventions
    from the 'jpeg' and 'png' packages).
